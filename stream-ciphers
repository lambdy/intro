Included python scripts have similar layouts with headers for ease of understanding. 
Conciseness of code was not a priority for this project â€“ functions exist that are only run once. 
This is done for two main reasons: 
  continuity between scripts (one script might run a function once while the other script runs the same function more than once), 
  and to abstract certain algorithms to ensure their effectiveness.
